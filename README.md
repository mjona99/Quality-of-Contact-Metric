# Quality-of-Contact-Metric

This is the workflow for a metric I created called QC+. 

In the first notebook, I go through data acqusition and cleaning. In the second notebook, I focus on feature engineering and selection. In the third notebook, I go through my modeling process, which includes stacking an XGBoost model with a generalized linear mixed-effects model. Lastly, in the fourth notebook, I validate the metric.

To do:
- [ ] clean up code
- [ ] finalize visualizations
- [ ] make into blog post
